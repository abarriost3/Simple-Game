This project and its files are only property of Antoni Barrios (abarriost3) and it is not permited to modify,
or to use this code; with exception of the SuperRandom.cs file. \n




I Tried to program a simple RPG game in console for 2 or 3 days, because I just wanted to code, and the result was this. (Not finished) \n \n


In this "game" you can attack an enemy and defeat it, but if it defeats you; then you lose the game and the screen closes.
The mechanics and goals of the game are not finished, because it was for testing how would it work before doing anything complex.


The commands that you type are:

[Enter] : attacks the enemy

[r] : resets you and the monster (for when you cant attack because of random stats)

[run] : resets only the monster

[0-9] : Spellbar, uses a spell to the enemy! (Mana cost of the spells not implemented yet, but the spellbar works 100%)

[a-j] : Itembar, uses an item that helps you (not implemented yet)

[<] : Moves 1 Page backwards of the TextBox

[>] : Moves 1 Page forward of the TextBox 




Im not currently programming in this project, because I have other things to do; but if you are interested in it,
please, feel free to contact me :)
